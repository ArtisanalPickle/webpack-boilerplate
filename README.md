I don`t believe in universal configurations and boilerplates when it comesto confugaration files, I believe every project sould be treated and configured individually.
Yet, there is a set of good practices that can help you with minimal project setup.

This project is a collection of webpack setups I find useful that you can copy directly and start using on your project.
They are not limited to only webpack, but also have ESLint and Stylelint configured for more convenience.

Every setup is based on webpack v4.

webpack-bolierplate
is a project that provides webpack v4 boilerplates out-of-box to quickstart development.
I decided to create after writing a couple of medium blogposts
